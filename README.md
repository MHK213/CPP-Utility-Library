# Title:
C++ Utility Library

# Description:
The Utility Library is a reusable C++ helper class that provides a collection of general-purpose static methods.<br>
I used static methods to access them without having to define an object..<br>
It includes random number generation, random character/word/key generation, array manipulation, data swapping, shuffling, and simple text encryption/decryption.<br>
This library is designed to simplify repetitive tasks and encourage clean, modular code reuse across projects<br>

# Used Functions
 - Generate random numbers and characters (letters, digits, special characters, or mixed)
 -  Generate random words and license-key style strings
 -  Swap values of multiple data types (int, double, bool, char, string)
 -  huffle integer arrays randomly
 -  Fill arrays with random data (numbers, words, or keys)
 -  Encrypt and decrypt text using encryption key

# Learning Objectives:
- Apply Object-Oriented Design Principle
- Encapsulate Reusable Logic
- Use Static Members and Methods
- Work with Randomization in C++
- Write Clean, Modular Code

This project is part of my personal learning journey.
